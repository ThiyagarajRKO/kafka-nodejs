## Node.js vs. Informatica Cloud Application Integration

1. Custom Connection - Allows creation of APIs without a predefined connection (e.g., using a dynamic access token).
2. WebSocket Support - Enables instant communication. For example, progress updates can be sent while executing a long process.
3. API Documentation - Node.js can easily integrate built-in Swagger for API documentation with minimal setup.
4. Iteration - Informatica lacks a built-in loop mechanism.
5. Caching - In Nodejs, Redis server can be added for caching to prevent repeated API calls to the same endpoint.
6. Error Handling - Node.js provides a straightforward error-handling mechanism with customizable responses. In contrast, Informaticaâ€™s error messages are harder to access and sometimes require navigating advanced log views to diagnose issues. The advanced view can be unclear, making it difficult to identify specific issues (e.g., "read memory limit exceeded" error was not clearly identifiable). Additionally, adding "fault handling" in Informatica can further reduce flow readability.
7. Access Logs - User IP, API method, and URL can be accessed easily in Node.js, but accessing this information in Informatica is less straightforward.
